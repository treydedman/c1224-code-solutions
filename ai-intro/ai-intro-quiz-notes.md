## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- Will AI replace software developers?

probably not, but developers who use ai will be in higher demand or even replace those who don't take advantage of ai due to the advantages it may afford.

ai answer: The short answer is: AI probably won’t replace software developers entirely, but it will absolutely change how they work. It’s more about evolving alongside AI rather than being replaced by it. Think of it as a power-up for developers, not their replacement.

\*observation
more or less the same

- What is the best way to use AI tools when learning software development?

wisely and cautiously! never for code generation as a beginner or you won't learn, and cautiously when using as an assistant or tutor for help. one must discern when and how to use it to be effective and efficient.

ai answer: AI tools can be a fantastic resource for learning software development! They act as your personal tutor, debugging assistant, and even your brainstorming partner.

\*observation
wasn't thinkig of debugging at the moment, but can see the potential it will offer

- What is the danger of using AI tools for software development while I'm still learning?

first and foremost, becoming dependent on it. it seems there has to be a strategy or goal in mind for a specific use or as a guideline so as not to use it as a lifeline. as a beginner the goal is to learn and build the skill set yourself.

By using AI tools mindfully and keeping your focus on learning, you can harness their power while avoiding the dangers of dependency or shallow understanding:

// 1. Over-Reliance on AI

// 2. Lack of Deep Understanding

// 3. Missing Best Practices

// 4. Security and Ethical Concerns

// 5. Limited Creativity Development

// 6. Misleading or Incorrect Code

// 7. Diminished Debugging Skills

// 8. False Sense of Mastery

// 9. Skipping Fundamental Knowledge

// 10. Ethical Dependency

\*observation
more or less the same although I didn't consider the ethical factor. it may hinder a project especially when thinking of security and/or privacy.
