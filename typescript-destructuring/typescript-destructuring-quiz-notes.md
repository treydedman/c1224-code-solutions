## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is destructuring, conceptually?

it allows you to unpack or extract properties from objects into individual variables

- What is the syntax for `Object` destructuring?

create a variable of destructured properties of an assigned object

const { property1, property2 } = object;

- What is the syntax for `Array` destructuring?

const [variable1, variable2, variable3 , variable4] = arrayName;

- How can you tell the difference between destructuring and creating `Object`/`Array` literals?

creating is assigning the properties to the object or array

destructuring is assigning a variable to the properties of the object or array

syntactically:
creating - object or array is named first, then assigned the properties

destructuring - object or array properties listed first, then assigned a name

you can identify the difference easily by
which side of the '=' the curly braces or brackets are on
