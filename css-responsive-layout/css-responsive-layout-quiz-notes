## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is a **breakpoint** in responsive Web design?

The points at which a media query is introduced, and the layout changed - so basically its a specific screen size or device width at which a website's layout changes to provide an optimal viewing experience

- What is the advantage of using a percentage (_e.g._ `50%`) width instead of a fixed (_e.g._ `px`) width for a "column" class in a responsive layout?

it allows the column to dynamically adjust its size proportionally based on the screen width rather than being a fixed specified width regardless of the screen size

- If you introduce CSS rules for a smaller `min-width` _after_ the styles for a larger `min-width` in your style sheet, the CSS rules for the **smaller** `min-width` will "win". Why is that?

cascading order - order matters in the sense that last will be first because it will override the previous ruleset
