## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is a function in JavaScript?

you define a function with its parameters, types, and return type
ex: function keyword followed by the function name, then the parameters, types, then the return.

- Describe the parts of a function **definition**.

the function name, the parameters (inputs), and the function body or code block

- Describe the parts of a function **call**.

the function name you want to execute, parenthesis, then optional arguments

- When comparing them side-by-side, what are the differences between a function **call** and a function **definition**?

definition is defining with function key word
call allows us to use the function to get specific results with specific input

- What is the difference between a **parameter** and an **argument**?

parameters are listed when its defined (placeholder) while arguments are passed when its called
parameters are defined within the function, while arguments are provided when you call the function

- Why are function **parameters** useful?

they allow a function to receive specific input values when called

- What two effects does a `return` statement have on the behavior of a function?

ends the execution of a function, and returns control to the calling function

- What is the syntax for defining an arrow function?

function keyword with function name then (parameters) => { function body };

implicit return and will be automatically returned
