## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is the purpose of variables?

they are containers for storing data values

- How do you **declare** a variable?

You declare variables using var, let, or const. Best practice is that const should be used except when the value of the variable is expected to change, then you would use let. In other situations you would use var.

- How do you initialize (**assign a value to**) a variable?

The = symbol is used as the assignment operator in TypeScript. It assigns the value on its right to the variable on its left.

Characters can include letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs, but must start with a letter, $, or \_.
